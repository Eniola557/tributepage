    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p><strong>Jarad Anthony Higgins</strong> (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He emerged as a leading figure in the emo and SoundCloud rap genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s. His stage name, which he said represents "taking over the world", was derived from the crime thriller film Juice (1992).</p>
   <p>Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 under the name <strong>JuicetheKidd</strong>, and signed a recording contract with fellow Chicago rapper Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions in 2017; he entered a joint venture with Interscope Records early the following year. He gained recognition with the diamond-certified 2018 single "Lucid Dreams", which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.</p> 
   <p>The song preceded his triple platinum debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which also included the Billboard Hot 100 entries "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous". He then released the collaborative mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018) with Future, as well as his second album, Death Race for Love (2019); the latter contained the hit single "Robbery" and became Higgins' first number one debut on the US Billboard 200.</p>
    <p>Higgins died of a drug overdose on December 8, 2019. His first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), matched chart records for most successful posthumous debut and for most U.S. top-ten entries from one album, while the single "Come & Go" (with Marshmello) became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Hot 100. His second posthumous album, Fighting Demons (2021), was released alongside the documentary film Juice Wrld: Into the Abyss and contained the U.S. top 20 single "Already Dead". His third posthumous album, The Party Never Ends (2024), was released alongside an appearance and virtual concert in the video game Fortnite.</p>
